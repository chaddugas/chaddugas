I love to build challenging, visually exciting, and unique applications on the web.\n\nOne of my favorite things about development is the massive toolbox of languages, libraries, and methodologies that you can pull from. I am *not* one of those people who thinks if you want to be good at design, you have to be bad at logic, or vise-versa. I like to pride myself on being excellent at all aspects of web development.\n\nIn any case, please feel free to have a look at any of my projects, and should the mood strike you, reach out on any to the platforms listed below.\n\n**Cheers!**",
