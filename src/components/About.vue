      h2 Hi, I'm Chad
    .section__content
      p Iâ€™m a Senior Frontend Engineer and Director of Frontend Development, living and working in Denver, Colorado. I love to build challenging, visually exciting, and unique applications on the web.

      p One of my favorite things about development is the massive toolbox of languages, libraries, and methodologies that you can pull from. I am not one of those people who thinks if you want to be good at design, you have to be bad at logic, or vise-versa. I like to pride myself on being excellent at all aspects of web development.

      p Please feel free to review any of my projects (scroll down), and should the mood strike you, reach out on any to the platforms listed below.

      p - Cheers!
